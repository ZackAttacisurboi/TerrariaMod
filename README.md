This mod adds drugs to Terraria. To use this mod, you will have to download the folder. This folder includes everything that will be added to the game. First, you will need to have TModLoader installed either through their website or through Steam.
Second, open File Explorer on Windows, then click on Documents. Access the My Games folder. Once it's opened, you should see a folder called Terraria. Open that up. You should see a folder named TModLoader.
If it's not there, try running TModLoader first, then it should appear. Now access the TModLoader folder, and open the ModSources folder. and put my DrugsMod folder into it.
Now, launch TModLoader. My mod should appear in the game. Make sure it's enabled by going to the Mods section in the game's main menu. If it's not enabled, enable it.
Now you can take drugs in Terraria.
This mod is planned for updates in the future to fix any bugs and add more content.
A Spanish translation is planned.
